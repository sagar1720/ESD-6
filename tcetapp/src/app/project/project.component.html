                This circuit is based on a passive infrared (PIR) sensor, which automatically switches on a device when someone comes close to it. It can be used for detection of theft or an unauthorised person entering a restricted area or building. It can also turn on lights when someone approaches the area where it is installed. Applications of this circuit include security systems, corridor lights and bathroom lights, among others.

              <p class="card-text">
                This type of infrared proximity circuit is widely used as an electric switch where physical contact is not desired for hygiene purpose. For example, we commonly see use of infrared proximity sensors on public drinking fountains and in public washrooms. The simple touch free timer switch circuit presented here can be operated by moving your hand in front of it. This is achieved by detecting the infrared light reflected by your hand onto a receiver device.

              <p class="card-text">
                Presented here is a infrared remote controlled timer circuit. The circuit comprises two sections, namely, the transmitter section and the receiver section. Fig. 1 shows the IR transmitter section. The astable multivibrator NE555 (IC1) is used to generate a 10kHz modulated IR signal. The output of IC1 is connected to the base of pnp transistor T1 via resistor R2. Two infrared LEDs (IR1 and IR2) are connected in series between the collector (via resistor R3) and ground. When switch S1 is pressed, the IR LEDs transmit the modulated IR signal of 10-11 kHz. This frequency can be changed with the help of VR1 potmeter.

              <p class="card-text">
                While driving on highways, motorists should not exceed the maximum speed limit permitted for their vehicle. However, accidents keep occurring due to speed violations since the drivers tend to ignore their speedometers. This speed checker will come handy for the highway traffic police as it will not only provide a digital display in accordance with a vehicleâ€™s speed but also sound an alarm if the vehicle exceeds the permissible speed for the highway.
